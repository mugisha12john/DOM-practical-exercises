🔥 DOM Challenge 2: “Task List Manager”


🎯 Goal:Build a simple To-Do List app that lets users:

-Add tasks via an input field.
-Mark tasks as complete.
-Delete individual tasks.
-Show total & completed tasks.
-Filter tasks by "All", "Completed", or "Incomplete".


✅ 1. Add New Task
When "Add Task" is clicked:
Get value from input.
Create a .task div with the task text.
Add two buttons: ✅ "Done" and ❌ "Delete".
Append to #taskList.
Clear the input field.

✅ 2. Mark as Done
When "Done" button is clicked:
Toggle .done class on the task.

✅ 3. Delete Task
When "Delete" button is clicked:
Remove that task.

✅ 4. Update Counts
Total tasks = all .task elements.
Completed tasks = tasks with .done.

✅ 5. Filter
"All" button → Show all tasks.
"Completed" → Show only .done tasks.
"Incomplete" → Show tasks without .done.
