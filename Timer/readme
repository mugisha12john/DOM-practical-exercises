Implement a timer that can count down from a user-set time to 0s.
The timer shall have a '+' and a '-' button, which adds/substracts one second from the time.
The timer shall have a 'reset' button, which sets the timer back to 0s.
The timer shall have a 'start' button, which starts the count down. When the button is clicked, it changes into a 'stop' button, which then stops the countdown.
The user can not use the '+', '-', or 'reset' button when the timer is started. These buttons can be used again when the timer is stopped, or the time reaches 0s.
