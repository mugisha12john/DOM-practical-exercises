Task 1: Display Product List with Add Buttons
Create a list of 5 products (name and price).
Each product should have an "Add to Cart" button next to it.
Initially, the cart total should be zero.


Task 2: Add Product to Cart and Update Total
When the user clicks "Add to Cart" on a product:
Add the product price to the cart total displayed on the page.
Update the total dynamically without refreshing the page.


Task 3: Remove Product from Cart and Update Total
Add a "Remove" button or checkbox next to each product in the cart summary.
When clicked/unchecked, subtract the product price from the total.
Make sure the total updates correctly when products are removed.



Task 4: Show Cart Items Count
Display the number of items currently in the cart.
Update this count every time a product is added or removed.


Task 5: Disable Add Button for Already Added Products
Once a product is added to the cart, disable its "Add to Cart" button to prevent duplicate addition.
Enable the button again if the product is removed from the cart.
